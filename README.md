# Islandora Piwik Integration

## Overview

This module provides integration with the [Piwik Open Analytics Platform](http://piwik.org/) via the Piwik Tracking HTTP API. It does not embed Javascript in pages.

Islandora Piwik tracks object usage and (optionally) collection usage. Object usage is straight foward: each time a user views an object at /islandora/object/pid, the request for that URL is recorded by Piwik.

Collection usage works differently. Each time an object is viewed, a "use" of the collection it is a member of is recorded. If an object is a member of more than one collection, each collection gets a use. Collection usage is recorded using a custom Piwik variable and reports are available under the "Visitors" tab in the Piwiki Dashboard, broken down by collection PID.

However, collections are also objects, so when the default collection object page is viewed, Piwik records a use of the collection as an object. Keep in mind that object usage and collection usage as describe in the previous paragraphs are not the same - object-level usage (including collections as objects) records how many times the object (or collection object) default display at /islandora/object/pid was viewed, whereas the collection usage records how many times objects in each collection were viewed. The two ways collections are counted are completely independent of each other. 

The module also tracks searches against Islandora using Islandora Solr Search, including searches that return zero results.

## Reports

Several Piwik report widgets (Real-time map, Visitor map, Islandora object pages, Islandora collection usage, Searches, and Searches returning no results) are available at admin/reports/islandora_piwik_reports to users who have been assigned the "View Islandora Piwik reports" permission. In order to enable these reports, you must enter your Piwik API key in the admin module's settings form. Data for these reports is from the current day. This is a proof-of-concept implementation and feedback is welcome.

The contrib [Piwik Reports](https://www.drupal.org/project/piwik_reports) works out of the box with data generated by Islandora Piwik. If the reports integration provided by this module isn't sufficient for your needs, give that module a try.

## Collection-specific site IDs

This module allows administrators to associate a Piwik site ID with a specific collection PID. This feature allows the provision of Piwik accounts to people who "own" a collection. Collection and object page visits are recorded using only the collection-specific site ID, not both it and the general site ID. Currently, only collection and object page visits are recorded for collections using this feature; site searches are not. Multiple collections can be associated with the same site ID.

If a collection is not associated with a site ID, page visits for it or its child collections use the general site ID. Reports don't work for collection-specific site IDs, only the general site ID.

## Dependencies

* Islandora
* A Piwik server

## Configuration

Visit admin/islandora/tools/piwik to configure this module. There is no set up on the Piwik side other than creating a site corresponding to your Islandora instance (and optionally, additional sites corresponding to specific Islandora collections).

## Feature requests

This module was written as part of a large migration to Islandora from another repository platform that provided collection-level usage data (hence the focus on collections in this module). That said, I'd like to make the module as useful to as many implementers as possible. Given the rich functionality of the contrib [Piwik Web Analytics](https://www.drupal.org/project/piwik) module, the goal of this module is to add functionality specific to Islandora installations. While I am open to all feature requests from the community, I reserve the right to preface my response to a request with "That isn't really in scope for this module....".
