## Feature requests

This module was written as part of a large migration to Islandora from another repository platform. It wasn't intended to be extensible or terribly flexible. So feel free to fork the Github repo and modify it to suit your needs. That said, if enough people +1 a featue identified in the issue queue or on the Islandora email lists, we can look at how we can develop the module further.
